# B Horn

I'm a software engineer interested in infosec and systems software.

## Education

### MSc Computing Science at Utrecht University (2020-2023)

My Masters Thesis focused on the [Parameterized Complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity) of Defensive Alliances (a graph theory problem about finding subsets of a graph where the vertices have more neighbours in the subset than outside of it).

### First Class Honours BSc Computer Science at Coventry University (2016-2020)

Thesis was on object detection in Satellite imagery, focused on the Sentinel 2 dataset.

## Publications

* ["Adapting SHELFs to make LKM-less Kernel Modules" in tmp.0ut #4](https://tmpout.sh/4/5.html)
* ["Misusing XDP to make a KV Store" in 'Paged Out! #5' (pg. 20)](https://pagedout.institute/download/PagedOut_005.pdf)

## Security

I have found security flaws in:

* [GRUB2](https://blog.b.horn.uk/posts/grabit/), which resulted in a bypass for UEFI Secure Boot.
* [TP-Link EAP Access Points](https://github.com/bahorn/security/tree/main/TP-Link-EAP-2022-10-16)
* [Terramaster NASs](https://github.com/bahorn/security/blob/main/Terramaster-TOS-2021-03-27/TOS-rsync.md)

## Hackathons

I founded [hack.athon.uk](https://hack.athon.uk), a website dedicated to helping
people get involved with the hackathon community and also to help organise them.

Throughout my undergraduate program, I attended over 20 Hackathons building
projects like:

* [Homebrew for the Vectrex](https://devpost.com/software/goose-v-velociraptors)
* [Using RF interference to make music](https://devpost.com/software/dj-whitenoize)
* [Internet Connected Trebuchet](https://devpost.com/software/internet-of-flings)
* [Dinorun controlled by Applause](https://devpost.com/software/applause-review)
* [Snake as a UEFI Shell Command](https://devpost.com/software/uefi-worm)

I was one of the co-founders of CovHackSoc, Coventry Universities hackathon
society, president from it's founding in 2017 until 2019.

I've been featured on [Major League Hacking's 2020 list of Top 50 Hackers](https://top.mlh.io/2020/profiles/beowulf-horn)
for "people who have stood out from the crowd and done something exceptional
within the hacker community"

### Organisational Roles

* Lead Organiser for [CovHack 2019](https://web.archive.org/web/20190322160452/https://covhack.org/)
* Tech Lead for [CovHack2020](https://web.archive.org/web/20200301172154/https://covhack.org/)
* Tech Lead for [HackQuarantine](https://hackquarantine.com)

## Travel

I've travelled to over 50 countries, doing things such as:

* Backpacking through Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan), the Southern Caucasus (Azerbaijan, Georgia and Armenia), South East Asia (including Malaysian Borneo and Brunei) and Ghana.
* Doing a Internship based around remote sensing in Cape Town, South Africa
