        <h1>B Horn (bah)</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a software engineer interested in infosec and systems software.
            Worked on various things from bootloaders and USB protocol reverse
            engineering to graph algorithms and remote sensing.
            I also used to organise hackathons during my undergrad.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>MSc Computing Science at Utrecht University (2020-2023)</h3>
        <p>
            My Masters Thesis focused on the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameterized_complexity">Parameterized
                Complexity</a> of
            Defensive Alliances (a graph theory problem about finding subsets of
            a graph where the vertices have more neighbours in the subset than
            outside of it).
        </p>
        <h3>First Class Honours BSc Computer Science at Coventry University (2016-2020)</h3>
        <p>
            Thesis was on object detection in Satellite imagery, focused on the
            Sentinel 2 dataset.
        </p>
        <h2>Publications</h2>
        <p>
            I've gotten some work of mine in zines:

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            I have found security flaws in:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://blog.b.horn.uk/posts/grabit/">GRUB2</a>,
                    a ton of issues ranging from stack clashes to
                    use-after-frees which resulted in me being able to develop a
                    bypass for UEFI Secure Boot.
                </li>

                    a predictable session issue that
                    I exploited via a timing side channel to determine when a user
                    was active.

        <h2>Travel</h2>
        <p>
        I've spent extensive time abroad and have been to over 50 countries.
        </p>
        <p>
            Done a lot of backpacking around the world.
            This includes backpacking through the Southern Caucasus (Azerbaijan,
            Georgia and Armenia) in 2017, Central Asia (Kazakhstan,
            Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) in 2018,
            Ghana in 2023, and every country bar one in South East Asia
            (including Malaysian Borneo, Brunei and Timor-Leste) in 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
            Travelled around solo in many off the beaten path places like
            Oecussi in Timor-Leste, Banggi Island and the Kelabit highlands in
            Borneo, and the Volta Region of Ghana.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've also done an internship based around remote sensing in Cape Town
            (South Africa) and Cultural
            Exchanges with school and university in Oslo (Norway), Helsinki
            (Finland) and Guangzhou (China).
        </p>
